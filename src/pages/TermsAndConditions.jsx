          Terms and Conditions (T&amp;C) – also known as Terms of Service, Terms of Use, or End User License Agreement (EULA) – represent a contract between you, the provider of a service, and your users.

          No, you are not legally required to have a Terms and Conditions agreement on your website or app. However, having one is highly recommended for a number of important reasons.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3 text-[#1a2b49] text-[18px]">
          Unlike a Privacy Policy - which is required by law in many jurisdictions if you collect personal information - a Terms and Conditions agreement is generally not mandated by law. But it serves as a legally binding contract between you and your users, allowing you to:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[#1a2b49] text-[18px] mb-3">
          <li>Set the rules and guidelines for using your website, app, or service</li>
          <li>Limit your liability in case of misuse or damages</li>
          <li>Protect your intellectual property and content</li>
          <li>Reserve the right to suspend or terminate user accounts for violations</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-[#1a2b49] text-[18px]">
          In summary, while not legally required, a Terms and Conditions agreement is a best practice that helps protect your business and set clear expectations with your users.
